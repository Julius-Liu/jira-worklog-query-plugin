jira-worklog-query-plugin
=========================

Worklog Query Plugin is a JIRA plugin enabling its users to run worklog 
queries and apply parameters on these queries through RESTful services. The 
plugin handles queries according to user roles, therefore, these queries can 
only be run on worklogs the user has appropriate permissions to access. 
Various filtering parameters can also be set up to narrow down the search 
results to a certain interval of time, user, user group and/or project. The 
result of the worklog query is served in JSON format.

The documentation of the plugin can be found on the [Wiki][1].

The version history can be found on the [Atlassian Marketplace][2].
